+ # In JS we have 3 improtant topics.
## 1)CONDITIONS

  ## > IF ELSE
  ### - Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. If the condition is true, the if block code is executed and if the condition is false, the else block code is executed.

  ## > Ternary Operator
  ### - The ternary operator is a simplified conditional operator like if / else.. It is written as :” and takes three operands; a logical condition, a value to return if true, and a value to return if false.

  ## > Switch Case 
  ### - The switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.. The default clause of a switch statement will be jumped to if no case matches the expression's value

  ## > FOR
  ### - The JavaScript for in statement loops through the properties of an Object:. It checks that i is less than nine, performs the two succeeding statements, and increments i by 1 after each pass through the loop

  ## > WHILE
  ### - Loops can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.. The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three. Note: Use the break statement to stop a loop before condition evaluates to true.

  ## >DO WHILE 
  ### - The do...while is used when you want to run a code block at least one time.. In the following example, the do...while loop iterates at least once and reiterates until is no longer less than 5

  ## 3)FUNCTIONS
![](https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.U-vZgxzc1GFARoMhOhplXAHaEK?rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain)
  ## > DECLARATION
  ### - The function declaration defines a functionwith the specified parameters. A functionis declared using the function keyword.The basic rules of naming a function are similar to naming a variable.

  ## > EXPRESSION
  ### - A function expression is very similar to and has almost the same syntax as a function declaration. The main difference betweena function expression and a functiondeclaration is the function name.

  ## > IIFE
  ### -An IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a function that runs the moment it is invoked or called in the JavaScript event loop.
